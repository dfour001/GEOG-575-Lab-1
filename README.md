# GEOG 575: Lab 1
A coupe notes on the lab:
1 - The fifth operator is calculate.  When the user clicks on a region, the total confirmed cases for the current date and the selected region’s % is calculated and displayed in the details box.

2 - I designed the map as if it was being embedded within a news article, so I also wrote a couple paragraphs before and after about the virus.  The map was placed in a position that naturally fits with the flow of the article.

3 - As circles grow in diameter, they also become more transparent.  The option to hide Hubei’s circle was also added to allow the user to more easily see the circles behind it.

4 - A mini-details pane was added to the map for mobile users, who might not have the resolution to see both the map and the main details box.  The mini-details pane is hidden in screens wider than 768px.
