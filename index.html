                <p>(Hallway) (Marty runs out of the room and sees the elevator. He runs to it, just as 3-D, Match and Skinhead come out of it.) 3-Hey, get back here! Hey, hey! (Marty runs to the stairs and runs down them. The gang follows him. Marty switches to the other flight of stairs and climbs back up. Biff's cronies do not realize he's done this and carry on downwards. Marty, now back at the top of the stairs, goes out onto the roof. Biff enters. He sees the door to the roof closing and realizes where Marty is.)</p>

On the page he turns to is a headline – “Local Author Shot Dead.” We stay focused on the paper as Doc speaks.) (v.o) I went to the public library to try and make sense out of all the madness. The place was boarded up, shut down, so I broke in and borrowed some newspapers. I don't get it Doc, I mean how can this be happening? It's like we're in hell or something.</p>
                <p>Look, a video game! I got it working. My dad told me about these. It is Wild Gunman. (He walks over to the game.) How do you play this thing? Let me show you kid. (He takes his hat off and throws it on top of the game.) I'm a crack shot at this.</p>
